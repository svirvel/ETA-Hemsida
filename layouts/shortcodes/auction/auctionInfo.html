          <ul>
            <li>Items are sold as-is, with no warranties given by ETA. If an item is tested as <i>working</i> this means that we have tested the basic functionality of the item and found it working. Unfortunately, we can't test everything in depth. An item marking as <i>not working</i> can mean that the equipment is completely broken or simply that a fuse needs replacement. We strive to keep the descriptions as accurate as possible, but reserve ourselves against errors in the catalogue.</li>
            <li>Lowest bid is 1 SEK.</li>
            <li>Payment is made directly after bidding to the cashier.</li>
            <li>For persons expecting to buy a lot it is possible to sign an account with a deposit of 500 SEK. All bought items will then be stored in a pallet which is picked up and payed for directly after the auction. To sign an account speak with the cashier before the auction begins.</li>
