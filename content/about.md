{{< sectionLargeText title="E-Sektionens Teletekniska Avdelning" style="padding-bottom:0;" >}}
E-Sektionens Teletekniska Avdelning (ETA) is a student-driven radio and electronics laboratory at Chalmers University of Technology. Our purpose is to give students the means to apply their knowledge in electronics. We offer our members access to electronic instruments, a mechanical workshop and our antenna park.

ETA was originally founded in 1935 as an amateur radio club by Chalmers students in cooperation with the university. Throughout the years ETA’s focus has shifted towards general electronics alongside the progress of the electronics industry. Today ETA provides the equipment necessary for a broader range of projects, specialising in electronics hardware.
